# Hey, I'm Brandon

I build AI-powered developer tools and smart contract infrastructure.

## What I'm Into

I believe enterprise AI tooling is the next major infrastructure layer. Not flashy consumer apps — the boring, critical stuff that actually runs companies.

A few things I'm particularly focused on:

**Local models for enterprise** — Most companies can't send proprietary data to external APIs. The future is powerful models running on-prem, fine-tuned on internal knowledge, with zero data leakage. I built [local_llm_runner](https://github.com/HCS412/local_llm_runner) to explore this.

**Security-first AI** — As AI gets embedded deeper into workflows, the attack surface expands. I'm interested in how we build AI systems that are auditable, constrained, and don't become liabilities.

**In-house tooling for startups** — Every startup eventually builds internal tools. The ones that build AI-native tooling early will move faster. I'm exploring what that looks like with projects like [BambooSnow](https://github.com/HCS412/BambooSnow).

**Smart contract infrastructure** — Web3 needs better developer experience. [ContractKit](https://github.com/HCS412/contractkit) is my take on making Solidity development less painful.

## Featured Projects
